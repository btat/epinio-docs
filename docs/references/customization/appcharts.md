# Customization point: Application Charts

Epinio uses Application charts as templates for the structure of deployed applications,
i.e. of the kubernetes resources used to run an application image.

An installation of Epinio provides a single standard application chart.

If custom application charts adapted to the local environment are desired or needed please
follow the instructions on
[How To create custom application Helm charts](../../howtos/create_custom_appcharts.md)
and
[How To use custom application Helm charts](../../howtos/using_custom_appcharts.md).
