#  Installation using a Custom Domain

For test and production environments. The installation will be done in three steps.

- Install ingress in cluster
- Configure your custom domain
- Install Epinio in cluster

If not done already, refer to [System Requirements](https://github.com/epinio/epinio#system-requirements) to prepare your kubernetes.

## Install the Epinio CLI

If not done already, refer to [Install the Epinio CLI](./install_epinio_cli.md).

## Install Ingress In Cluster

First install ingress and wait for the `loadbalancer-ip` to be provisioned for the `traefik` public IP. Then map the `loadbalancer-ip` to your `Domain Name` e.g. `test.example.com` and wait for it to be mapped.

```bash
epinio install-ingress
```

The command prints the `loadbalancer-ip` ("EXTERNAL-IP") needed. Note however that it can also print a loadbalanced FQDN instead, which may resolve to multiple IPs.

## Configure your custom DOMAIN

Currently we recommend to configure a wildcard domain for Epinio.

Given you own the domain **"example.com"**, you would configure a subdomain e.g. **"test.example.com"** for Epinio.
Now you will have to configure your DNS in a way, that any request towards "test.example.com" will resolve to the "EXTERNAL-IP" of Traefik, 
and Ingress will route the traffic accordingly.

- test.example.com => "EXTERNAL-IP"
- \*.test.example.com => "EXTERNAL-IP"

***

###### Note you can also check the "EXTERNAL-IP" by running the command `kubectl get svc -n traefik`.

***

Find [DNS Configuration Examples](#dns-configuration-examples) below.

## Install Epinio In Cluster
With DNS now available the second step actually installs the cluster:

```bash
epinio install --system-domain test.example.com --tls-issuer=letsencrypt-production --use-internal-registry-node-port=false
```

***

###### Note: The issuer `letsencrypt-production` will work only, if your custom domain, e.g. "test.example.com", is reachable from the internet. For test, or internal environments, where your custom domain isn't reachable from the internet, you need to choose a different issuer. E.g. if you would use the custom domain "test.internal.com", `epinio install --system-domain test.internal.com` will default to the `epinio-ca` issuer.

***

## DNS Configuration Examples

### AWS EKS and Route53

As an example we will use the [AWS Service Route53](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/home#Dashboard) to create a wildcard domain within one of your existing "Hosted zones", e.g. **example.com**.

Given Epinio ingress installation provided you with the following hostname:

```bash
Traefik Ingress info: [{"hostname":"abcdefg12345671234567abcdefg1234-1234567890.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com"}]
```

***

###### Note you can also check the "EXTERNAL-IP"/FQDN by running the command `kubectl get svc -n traefik`.

***

Now you will have to add two CNAME records, for the subdomain, e.g. "test" to have "test.example.com", resp. "\*.test.example.com".
Replace "abcdefg12345671234567abcdefg1234-1234567890.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com" with the your EKS FQDN, and "test.example.com" with your custom domain.

##### test.example.com

```bash
Record name: test
Record type: CNAME - Routes traffic to another domain name and some AWS resources
Value: abcdefg12345671234567abcdefg1234-1234567890.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

##### \*.test.example.com

```bash
Record name: *.test
Record type: CNAME - Routes traffic to another domain name and some AWS resources
Value: abcdefg12345671234567abcdefg1234-1234567890.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```

Finally, running 

`> host test.example.com`, or even

`> host epinio.test.example.com`

should resolve to e.g. "abcdefg12345671234567abcdefg1234-1234567890.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com".

### Azure AKS and "example-domain"

As an example we will use the Azure resource group "example-domain", with the zone "example.com".

Given Epinio ingress installation provided you with the following hostname:

```bash
Traefik Ingress info: [{"ip":"10.0.0.1"}]
```

***

###### Note you can also check the "EXTERNAL-IP"/FQDN by running the command `kubectl get svc -n traefik`.

***

Now you will have to add two A records, for the subdomain, e.g. "test" to have "test.example.com", resp. "\*.test.example.com" to the DNS zone "example.com".
Replace "10.0.0.1" with the IP from "Traefik Ingress info", and "test.example.com" with your custom domain.

##### test.example.com

```bash
Record name: test.example.com
Record type: A
IP address: 10.0.0.1
```

##### \*.test.example.com

```bash
Record name: *.test.example.com
Record type: A
IP address: 10.0.0.1
```

Finally, running

`> host test.example.com`, or even

`> host epinio.test.example.com`

should resolve to e.g. "10.0.0.1".

### Bind DNS

Given Epinio ingress installation provided you with the following hostname:

```bash
Traefik Ingress info: [{"ip":"10.0.0.1"}]
```

***

###### Note you can also check the "EXTERNAL-IP"/FQDN by running the command `kubectl get svc -n traefik`.

***

Now you will have to add two A records, for the subdomain, e.g. "test" to have "test.example.com", resp. "\*.test.example.com" to e.g. "/var/lib/named/master/forward/example.com".
Replace "10.0.0.1" with the IP from "Traefik Ingress info", and "test.example.com" with your custom domain.

```bash
$ORIGIN example.com.
test			A	10.0.0.1
$ORIGIN test.example.com.
*			A	10.0.0.1
```

Restart bind and verify that e.g. `> host test.example.com` or `> host epinio.test.example.com` will resolve to "10.0.0.1".
