#### A Quick Note On Security

Epinio secures access to its API with TLS and basic authentication.

Use the `epinio config update` command after installation to extract and save the necessary credentials
(user, password) and certificates. The information is stored in Epinio's configuration,
for pickup by other Epinio commands.

For a trial deployment the certificate securing the API will be generated by the
underlying cluster, and self-signed, and its CA certificate is stored in the
configuration to allow verification.

For a production-oriented deployment on the other hand, with a proper
domain specified (`--set domain=...` when installing the chart), the certificate is obtained from
[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) instead. Nothing is stored in the
configuration in that case, as Let's Encrypt is a known CA.

How Kubernetes accesses the Epinio registry (TLS or not) is handled a bit differently depending on installation flags.
