## How to use Port Forwarding

This how-to demonstrates how to use port forwarding to access or debug a running application.

To prepare the application for debugging the flag [`BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED`](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/java/#enable-remote-debugging) has to be set to `true`.  
With the epinio cli this is done by setting the environment variable for the application:

```
epinio app env set samplejava BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED true
```

After the application has restarted (to integrate the change of the environment) port forwarding can be started with the `port-forward` command:

```
epinio app port-forward samplejava 34505:8000 34506:8080
```

This will forward the traffic coming from `localhost:34505` to the remote `:8000` and the `localhost:34506` to the remote `:8080`.
__Note__ that specification of the local port is optional. When none is provided a random port will be selected.

### Point to a specific instance

Port forwarding can be directed to a specific instance of your app. To do this list all the instances of the application, pick the desired ID, and then use the `--instance` flag to direct the port forwarding to that instance:

```
-> % epinio app show samplejava
