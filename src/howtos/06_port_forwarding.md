## How to use Port Forwarding

If you would like to use port forwarding to access or debug your running application this how-to will show you how to do it.

If you want to debug your app you will need to set to `true` the [`BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED`](https://paketo.io/docs/howto/java/#enable-remote-debugging) flag.  
To do so you can use the cli to set the environment variable on your app:

```
epinio app env set samplejava BPL_DEBUG_ENABLED true
```

Then you can start port forwarding with the `port-forward` command:

```
epinio app port-forward samplejava 34505:8000 34506:8080
```

This will forward the traffic coming from `localhost:34505` to the remote `:8000` and the `localhost:34506` to the remote `:8080`.
The local port is optional, if none is provided then a random port will be selected.

### Point to a specific instance

You can also point to a specific instance of your app. Just list them and pick the corresponding ID, then point to the app specifying it with the `--instance` flag:

```
-> % epinio app show samplejava
